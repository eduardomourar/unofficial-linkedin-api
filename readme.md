# Linkedin Unofficial API 

## Disclaimer
- This is an unofficial API for linked in. Use at your own risk. This package could break if Linkedin does a major update. 

- It is also a possibility that the account that is used could get banned. However, in all of my testing I haven't seen this happen. This package has a random sleep timer to help stay under-the-radar.

- The `getURIFromEmail` function uses linkedin navigator. There is a relatively low rate-limit here for normal accounts and slightly higher premium accounts. Think 70 and 500ish respectively. 

## Contributing

This project was open sourced to help add new endpoints. 

You can find the endpoints for new elements by loading linkedin.com (logged in), and right-click 'view source'. 

From there there the endpoints will be in the source code.

From there you can use the Dev Tools network tab to find the headers that are used. Usually it requires a `crsf-token` header with a value found in the cookie from when you login. There is a helper function for this located in `src/utils/helpers` called `getJSESSIONFromJar`

Right now the transformer is pretty messy. I'd appreciate help cleaning it up.

To contribute, please open an issue or PR and document any changes for the end user. I will approve review and approve them. 

I will write tests.

## Example
```
const client = require('unoffical-linkedin-api')

(async () => {

    try {
        // Login Cookie Saved
        await client.login(process.env.EMAIL, process.env.PASSWORD)

        const profileURI = client.getURIFromEmail('test@gmail.com')
        
        const identifier = client.getProfileIdentifierFromURI(profileURI)

        /* The second parameter, if true, uses the transformer to remove proprietary linkedin junk and 
        * also get's more skills and experience. The skills and experience initially returned are limited.
        */

        const profile    =  client.getProfileById(identifier, false)

        console.log(profile)

    } catch(e) {
        console.error(e)
    }
      
})()
```
